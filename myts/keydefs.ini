;;; input key definitions is in one generic section [INKEYS],
;;; plus system-specific ones ([INKEYS-DX], INKEYS-K3]) which are
;;; used depending on the system.
;;; Definitions are of the form Code = Name ....
;;; CODE is a number optionally preceded by s, f, v to indicate
;;; that the corresponding names on the right are meant to be sent
;;; with sendshift (s), or on /proc/fiveways (f) or /proc/volume (v)
;;; In case of multiple names, codes are assigned sequentially.
;;; Special case, the code ROWn where n is a number correspond
;;; to row in the 'Symbol' menu.
;;; NAME is the symbolic name of the key, used in actions.
;;; Single-char names correspond to ascii chars and are case sensitive.
;;; other names are case insensitive.
;;; use \\ to protect special chars (space, ; and #)
;;; # is a valid comment only before a '='
